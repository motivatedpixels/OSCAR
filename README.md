# O.S.C.A.R.
Every year, I hold an Oscar party. 

Many of us dress up in costumes from movies that year. We watch the show, eat and drink, and play games.

One of the games is O.S.C.A.R. It's like Bingo, but with different letters. Yup, I'm clever.
I used to manually generate the random cards using Illustrator and a lot of patience.
For our 20th anniversary of the party this year (2026), I decided to (finally) build an app to do the randomization, layout, and printing for me.

It's now super easy to generate your own O.S.C.A.R. sheets for your own party.

If you'd like to update what gets randomized for each cell, modify the `input/oscar.txt` file and run the app again. Super easy.

*This app was vibe coded with Claude. Enjoy!*
